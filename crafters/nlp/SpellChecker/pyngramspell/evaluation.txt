men had their heads cut in half .
My work on a farm I have live on a farm all off|of my life , I am not bosting|boasting but I think I know a fair bit about farming .
I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery .
Some people say farming is the lowest payed|paid and hardest working imployment|employment out .
I agree with those people .

some people when the|they catch you they might hit you and said|say he will hit you harder next time he catches you .
But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat .
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses .
I never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be reconnised|recognized very easy because red shows up very easy .
The Fox The fox is a sly old beast He sits in his den cleaning and waiting To make a_nother|another savage attack He walks the field to the farm The smell of chickens in the passing breeze .
He makes a leap .
Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal .
WINTER When the snow lay round about The robins come out to seek crumbs Their feet are numb But the snow still lies round about .

The man who swam from the island went down to the store room .
He held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water .
As he open|opened the store room door the water gushed in very quickly .
So he had to feel for the diving suits .
He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5 .
He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent to|two men to help him .
When they arrived they all put their diving suits on the|then went down to get some food .
Luckily|Lucky enough it was mostly tin|tinned food .
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island .
When looking around the deck they saw a life_boat|lifeboat but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in .
They all had one tin of something each .
They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough .
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts .
They all decided that there would only be two meals a day .
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested .
There was about 35 on the island but people who use't|used to get coconuts usally|usually got lost or got bitten by a snake .
They had shortend|shortened done|down from 35 to 15 .
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to .
And they could also catch fish to eat .
After several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so they kill|killed animals and drank fresh water from springs .
they found here and there .
they found coconuts while hunting for animals .
They took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside .
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the gound|ground and sticks laide|laid across with grass on top of them .
At night they slept all together under coconut trees .
They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning .
One morning in december a ship was going across the sea to England they waved and waved again .
Then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted .
They all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since .
They arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England again .

After the Drink
When I leave School
I am going to leave school at 15 , at Easter , 1962 , and I shall work for two years at least before I think about getting a boy .
I want to get married at 20 , so that I will have about three years to get engaged , and to get to know each other .
I wand|want two children , one of each or twins .
I also want to live in a bungalow I want a man with lovely black or brown wavey|wavy hair not much taller than me .
I want a man that likes children and takes them out , and plays with them .
Then we will all be able to go out and enjoy ourselves .
I shall stop nursing when I get married , after I have had a child , then I may do part-time work .
I want to get married in white .
I want to go abroad for my honeymoon .
For the first summer holiday , I would like to go to Butlin's holiday camp .
For my children I would like a blue and white or Black pram .
Stephen asked me if I would like to go , so he bought two tickets for him and me , and we went in and Pauline and Trevor were sitting in there holding hands .
the best boyfriend I ever had .
and so Stephen left .
But we still send letters and post_cards|postcards to each other .
So that we still remember each other .
So I got ready and set off to the station .
They said that they would put up notices about the baby .
They let me look after him until someone owned up .
A month later .
A month went but nobody owned up and the Police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said I could adopt the baby if I wanted to , if not they would put it in a home .
I soon got married and talked it over with my husband , and he said it was OK , with him so , in a few day's|days' time the baby was ours and were'nt|weren't we pleased .
So we all lived happily ever after .
The End .
I like looking after young children , I will be able to get home now and then , and see may|my parents .
If one of the children decide that they want to run away then of course we must go and look for them , and bring them back .
IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS .
One day , about the second week , I was going shopping , and takeing|taking my friend for a walk .
When three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags , for me , of course I went as red as beetroot , but when I came back they called me again so after a while I went and Picked it up I started talking to them every day .
Betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner , they got 2 lb of potatoes , 1 large tin beans , and 1 / 2lb ham , and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6 / - 10d , when they got home the girls cooked the meal .
they started out and the sea got deeper , but it was lovely , the sun was shining like a star glittering at night , the sea was calm and bright , as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea , it was just like a dream which has come true .
Because its|it's night time and dark .
Because the wind is wild .
Because the two waves are a ring .
It's where the sea has washed away The side of the rocks .
The front of the boat Where the sea ran up the beach .
Because there are trees in way There whispering to each other The sun is hot with wild animals roaming around .
The beach is so hot and the sea is calm , animals are roaming , here and there .
A love story in French .

Sir ,
Mr . T . says Mr . Holbrook is to|too soft with us by not teaching us spellings .
I agree with Mr t because you can_not|cannot write a good story without knowing how to spell , I am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words differcult|difficult but people who get under 40 find words very differcult|difficult .
If you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school .
I think Mr Holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so I think it is essential that we should write properly .
I have written a lot of stories in the term I have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so I find it quite easy .
William Glebe
Sir ,
We write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them .
Mr T said it will be , be harder for us when we leave school , but if we consantrate|concentrate , and listern|listen to what we are told in English we will have no trouble when we go out into the world .
When we write stories , I think the story is much more important than the spellings , and puntuation|punctuation .
Yours faithfully Judith
When we have Mr Holbrook we have to write a story , and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea your|you're tinking|thinking of .
Jack O'Malley
we have to work hard , and it tacks|takes hard work to write thoese|these story|stories and it very hard when people say he soft on us .

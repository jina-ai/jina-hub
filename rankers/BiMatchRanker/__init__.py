class BiMatchRanker(Chunk2DocRanker):
    """The :class:`BiMatchRanker` counts the best chunk-hit from both query and doc perspective.

    `BiMatchRanker` tries to assign a score for a `match` given a `query` based on the matches found for the `query`
    chunks on the `match` chunks.

    The situation can be seen with an hypothetical example:

    `Documents in the Index`:
        - Granularity 0 - Doc 1 - `BiMatchRanker is a Hub Executor. computes relevance scores. Found in Jina, the neural search framework`
                        - Granularity 1 - Doc 11 - `BiMatchRanker is a Ranking Jina Hub Executor`
                                        - Doc 12 - `It is a powerfull tool.`
                                        - Doc 13 - `Found in Jina`
                                        - Doc 14 - `the neural search framework`
        - Granularity 0 - Doc 2 - `A Ranker executor gives relevance Scores. Rankers are found in the Hub, and built automatically`
                        - Granularity 1 - Doc 21 - `A Ranker executor gives relevance Scores`
                        - Granularity 1 - Doc 22 - `Rankers are found in the Hub`
                        - Granularity 1 - Doc 23 - `and built automatically`

    `Query`
        - Granularity 0 - 'A Hub Executor. Ranking on Relevance scores. Giving automatically relevant documents from the Hub'
                        - Granularity 1 - `A Hub Executor`
                                        - `Ranking on Relevance scores`
                                        - `Giving automatically relevant documents from the Hub`

    `Semantic similarity matches` (TOP_K 3)
        Query chunk 1 -> `A Hub Executor` -> Doc11, Doc22, Doc21 (Children of `Doc1` and `Doc2`)
        Query chunk 2 -> `Ranking on Relevance scores` -> Doc21, Doc11, Doc22 (Children of `Doc2` and `Doc1`)
        Query chunk 3 -> `Scoring relevant documents`  -> Doc21, Doc22, Doc23 (Children of `Doc2`)

    In order to compute this relevance score, it tries to take into account two perspectives.

        - Match perspective: How many chunks of a match are part of the set of matches (hit) of a query (and its chunks).
            In the example:
                - `Doc1` has 4 chunks, but only 1 (hit) (Doc11) is found in the matches of the query chunks.
                - `Doc2` has 3 chunks and 2 of them (hit) are found in the matches (Doc21, Doc22).

        - Query perspective: Of all the chunks in the query, how many of them are matches by any of the chunks of each match document.
            In the example:
                - `Query` for `Doc1`: Query has 3 chunks, but only 2 of them are matched by chunks of match `Doc1` (Doc11)
                - `Query` for `Doc2`: Query has 3 chunks, and the 3 of them are matched by chunks of match `Doc2`

    So for every `Document`, a score is computed adding some penalty to the `missing` in both perspectives.
